🏠 Airbnb Paris Analysis
This project explores the evolution of the Airbnb market in Paris, focusing on how regulations, locality trends, and pricing dynamics have influenced both host participation and customer demand.

The analysis covers data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and insights generation with clear visualizations and business recommendations.

📌 Objectives
Understand Airbnb supply trends in Paris (2008–2021).
Analyze the impact of the 2017 rental regulations on host participation.
Explore locality-wise pricing patterns and affordability.
Study the relationship between accommodation capacity and average price.
Provide business insights & recommendations for stakeholders.
📊 Key Insights
Rapid Growth (2008–2016): Strong host entry and expansion of listings.
Regulatory Shift (2017): Significant slowdown in new hosts entering the market.
Resilient Demand: Despite fewer new listings, customer demand stayed stable.
Pricing Trends: Competition lowered prices pre-2017, but post-regulation supply constraints pushed prices upward.
Locality Insights: Central Paris commands premium prices, while outer neighborhoods attract budget travelers.
🚀 Recommendations
Focus on premium central areas while maintaining offerings in budget-friendly neighborhoods.
Implement dynamic pricing to balance supply-demand fluctuations.
Diversify listings, especially targeting medium-capacity stays (3–6 guests).
Strengthen customer experience with quality listings and repeat-stay strategies.
Stay compliant and adapt to evolving local regulations for long-term sustainability.
